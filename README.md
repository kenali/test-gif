# React + TypeScript + Vite application

Short guide how to tun app :

1. Do command npm install
2. Create .env file in the root directory and put inside available api key which you can pull from https://developers.giphy.com/
3. npm run dev

In this project I decided to use Tailwind for style and redux toolkit for state management.

Have a nice day :)
